Hello, there is the David Corona’s GitHub profile.

If I applied to a job in your company, maybe you are interested in the next Python 🐍 repositories:

👨🏾‍💻	data_science: Explore my hands-on projects in Data Science, where I leverage NumPy for numerical computations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for insightful visualizations.

🤖	machine_learning: Unveiling patterns in images with supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms using KNN, Mahalanobis and a perceptron.

🎾	tennis_project: Unleash your potential on the court! This is a personal project that uses data analysis to help amateur tennis players improve their understanding of the game. 

⚡algorithm_analysis: No code portfolio is complete without good algorithm analysis; It is essential to optimize anything.

The list above calls some projects I am developing to practice mi abilities with python and to display as my portfolio 💼; every one of those projects has a requirements file 📁 with the necessary libraries to successfully execute the codes and another describing what I did, how I did it, why I did it. If you have any problem with this, please send me a message or an email 📬 to devdavcor@gmail.com. 

Now, if you only are looking for 🔎 a resource to learn Python 🐍, maybe you are interested in:

👨🏽‍🏫	curso_Python: a little course with the explanation of python since its origins to the first lines of code from a beginner.
In both cases, you are free to explore the content of all my public repositories.

All projects are in constantly change, so if one of these (or all of these) are unavailable be patient, it could be ready in a couple of days.
